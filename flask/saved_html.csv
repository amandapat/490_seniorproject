Here's what they think of him (CNN)Donald Trump is effectively forcing every Republican who wants a political future to show how far they're willing to compromise on principle, truth and conscience for power.Most GOP leaders with aspirations of higher office don't think twice before genuflecting before the former President. But the party's No. 3 House leader, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, is making a lonely stand by refusing to appease Trump over his incitement of the Capitol insurrection and claims of a stolen election. And her attitude seems almost certain to sacrifice a promising career in the defense of democratic values.The lawmaker's power base splintered in plain sight on Tuesday, once again demonstrating Trump's formidable control over his party, which, if anything, has solidified since he left power after his humiliating election loss.Cheney appears certain to face another attempt to oust her from her post as soon as next week, three months after easily repelling a previous attempt to remove her in a secret ballot. This time, her survival is in grave doubt.More from CNN PoliticsHow a vote on Liz Cheney's leadership post could happenLiz Cheney is playing a different game | Analysis by CNN's Gloria BorgerCheney: What Trump did 'is a line that cannot be crossed'In the Hunger Games that is the House Republican Conference, Cheney was effectively pushed by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who made the opposite choice regarding fealty to Trump. The California Republican, in his zeal to capture power in the form of the speaker's gavel next year, has committed the House GOP to Trump despite his violent exit from the White House. And he made clear Tuesday that Cheney's position is irreconcilable with his own.Read MoreTwo sources familiar with Cheney's conversations with members right now tell CNN's Lauren Fox that Cheney feels at peace with where she has stood on the election, on January 6 and her comments about Trump. Her calculation is that it is not worth trying to keep the leadership position if it requires lying about the election or the events that transpired leading up to January 6.Enter your email to sign up for CNN's The Point with Chris Cillizza. close dialogSign up for CNN's CNN's Chris Cillizza cuts through the political spin and tells you what you need to know.

McCarthy is far from alone in his party.Another Republican who has made a similar choice on a fast-rising climb to power is Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who worked in the Bush-Cheney White House as a domestic policy adviser and is now a favorite to assume Liz Cheney's leadership post.Stefanik completed her conversion to loyal Trump supporter with her outspoken defenses of the then-President during his two impeachments in the House. She also voted to overturn Pennsylvania's electoral vote for President Joe Biden, based on false claims of electoral fraud rejected by multiple courts.Stefanik's aspirations to join the leadership have been bolstered by McCarthy's support, making it all but assured that Stefanik, who has shown ambition and a willingness to tailor her appeal to the party's base in seizing her moment, will ascend to the post, CNN's Lauren Fox and Manu Raju reported. In a development first reported by Punchbowl News, she is also supported by the No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise, who is another staunch supporter of the former President.Stefanik is a strong fundraiser and has advanced the cause of female candidates in the party -- an important consideration given that the GOP needs to do more to appeal to women in suburban districts.A lonely exile The few Republicans who chose the same path as Cheney, or who honor the principles that once anchored the party that won the Cold War, are doomed to defeat or exile, like former leaders of a political movement overtaken by its radicalizing dogma.Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, is hassled by Trump fans at airports and booed at party conventions for his votes to impeach an aberrant President who abused his power. Others, like Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, face primary challenges for daring to expose Trump's lies about a stolen election. In the service of his ego and his wounded pride after losing handily to Biden last year in a free and fair election, Trump is completing the work he began in 2015 of purging anyone from the Republican Party who does not share his populist, nationalist creed and rejects his personality cult.Try as they might to avoid it, each Republican leader eventually faces the same choice over whether to side with Trump or to stick firm to more traditional Republican principles like the rule of law and support for democracy.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky resolved the dilemma by forcibly condemning Trump over the Capitol attack -- but by voting not to convict the former President in an impeachment trial after he left office. McConnell may abhor Trump's actions, but his hopes of winning back the Senate may hinge on finding a way to accommodate the ex-President's supporters and acolytes in close races in the midterm elections next year.Cheney -- one of the few remaining representatives of the archconservative but orthodox wing of Republicanism, which was also represented by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney -- has been showcasing her choice publicly for days.Rather than hide from Trump's attacks, Cheney has repeatedly countered his false claims about election fraud. The cost for her political apostasy has become ever more clear in recent days.But in a tweet on Monday that might end up being the last straw for her colleagues, the Wyoming lawmaker directly rebuked Trump's efforts to rebrand the phrase the ""Big Lie"" as the name for his own false claims of voter fraud.""The 2020 presidential election was not stolen. Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system,"" Cheney wrote.There has been plenty of buzz in Washington over whether Cheney is playing some clever double game in her defiance of Trump -- perhaps laying the groundwork for some symbolic long-shot presidential bid in 2024. It seems more likely, however, that any White House ambitions would have to await the 2028 election should Trumpism be rejected by the electorate, whether in a campaign by the former President or a proxy in three years.But comments by Cheney at a conference in Georgia this week, reported by CNN's Jamie Gangel and Michael Warren, make a convincing case that she is acting not out of political calculation but conviction.""We can't embrace the notion the election is stolen,"" Cheney said. ""It's a poison in the bloodstream of our democracy."" She added that a ""peaceful transfer of power must be defended"" and described the Constitution as a ""shield.""There is little politically for her to gain, at least in the short term, in a party that has fully accepted Trump's false reality about election fraud.McCarthy may have sealed Cheney's fate McCarthy argued on Tuesday on Fox News that Cheney was a liability not because of her vote to impeach Trump but because she could no longer ""carry out the message. We all need to be working as one, if we're able to win the majority.""Yet Cheney has in fact adopted a strong, detailed critique of Biden's ambitious agenda that if enacted would amount to a multi-trillion-dollar effort to remake the US social safety net not seen since the 1960s.Two weeks ago, she argued that Biden was pursuing ""even farther left policies than we could have anticipated and certainly than he campaigned on."" Cheney has also forcibly contested Biden's plans to withdraw from Afghanistan, though the President's instincts may hew closer to the Trump base on this one issue than her own hawkish national security principles.But McCarthy's implication that Cheney is unable to unite the party behind her is probably correct, given her refusal to quiet her criticisms of Trump as he weaves constant deception over last year's election.There is no doubt that Cheney is an outlier in her party nationally as well as in Washington. Part of Trump's appeal was that he rejected the neoconservatism of former GOP titans like Vice President Cheney, shared by his daughter, that led the United States into more than a decade of painful modern wars.Since President George W. Bush and Cheney left the White House in 2009, the principles of traditional conservatism they espouse have been obliterated. The former President has also recently broken his post-presidential silence about politics and expressed disbelief over the state of his party.But in many ways, Bush and Cheney are yesterday's men, and Trump made sure to include a swipe at the old guard in one of his recent statements, which are now posted on his new website platform that is an attempt to get around social media bans imposed over his inflammatory rhetoric.""Heartwarming to read new polls on big-shot warmonger Liz Cheney of the great State of Wyoming,"" Trump wrote in one statement, which now features buttons so his fans can repost it to Twitter and Facebook. ""I say she'll never run in a Wyoming election again!""If Cheney does conclude she has no constituency even in one of the most conservative states in the union, one that has been linked to her family for decades, her decision will only underscore Trump's dominance over the party that he still effectively leads.

        Cameron Cawthorne, Joe Schoffstall | Fox NewsFacebookTwitterFlipboardCommentsPrintEmailcloseFox News Flash top headlines for May 6Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.President Biden has padded his administration with a number of individuals with strong ties to progressive dark money groups, including his chief of staff Ron Klain, which could provide a pipeline for the groups to push their agendas to the White House.Biden has surrounded himself with such individuals despite aligning with the left-wing flank by calling for ""an end [to] dark money groups"" on his campaign website.Klain, who has a long history with Biden dating back to the 1980s, now helps steer his political agenda from the Oval Office. Klain has ties to the Center for American Progress (CAP) Action Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based organization led by Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta. Klain for several years served on the group's board of directors, which does not disclose its donors in tax forms.BIDEN ELECTION VICTORY FUELED BY LEFT-WING DARK MONEY GROUPS  CAP held significant influence with the Obama administration as Biden served as vice president, and likely will again with Klain as Biden's right-hand man. Klain has touted CAP several times on Twitter over the years and praised their 2018 pressure campaign to get businesses to cut ties with the National Rifle Association, tweeting, ""Big big big kudos to the team at @thinkprogress @amprog for spearheading this dramatic turnaround!!!""""Believe it or not: dark money is about to get even darker,"" Klain tweeted in 2018, less than a year before Biden announced his candidacy for president. Biden heavily benefited from hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, according to a Center for Responsive Politics analysis.Despite Klainâs influence with Biden, CAP's reach within the administration extends far beyond him. Nearly 60 people with ties to the group have been tapped for key posts, Business Insider reported. Denis McDonough, head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Carmel Martin, deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council for economic mobility, and Kelly Magsamen, chief of staff to Secretary of Defense Llyod J. Austin III, all worked for the group.
      Ron Klain is President Biden's White House chief of staff.
      Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm also has strong ties to dark money groups. Prior to being nominated by Biden in December 2020, Granholm served as a senior adviser to Media Matters for America from January 2017 until November 2020.  She received monthly retainer payments from the media watchdog group totaling over $200,000, according to her financial disclosure report.Granholmâs connection to the group, which is run by liberal operative David Brock, has come in handy. Media Matters recently came to her defense following a report from the Washington Free Beacon showing that she still possesses up to $5 million in investments in energy company Proterra, Inc., which Biden has touted. In January, Granholm said she would step away from Proterraâs board and relinquish her vast investments in the company, but has yet to do so. BIDEN CLIMATE NOMINEE TOUTED 'ENVIRONMENTAL UPSIDEâ TO PANDEMICOther key Biden personnel who are in charge of environmental policies and climate agendas are plugged into left-wing advocacy groups who focus on the issue. EPA administrator Michael Regan served as associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, and Biden climate advisor Gina McCarthy, who led the EPA under the Obama administration, was president and chief executive officer of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

      ""From his White House climate czar to his chief of staff, White House Counsel's office and even his own press secretary, Joe Biden has filled top positions in his administration with people who worked for groups that are part of the massive Arabella Advisors liberal dark money network; they have more influence over judicial nominations, extreme environmental policy and other issues than anyone else,"" said Caitlin Sutherland, president of Americans for Public Trust.Arabella Advisors, a D.C.-based consulting firm, manages four dark money funds that have poured billions into left-wing groups and initiatives in recent years. Many of the groups tied to Bidenâs personnel have received millions in anonymous cash that was passed through the network. CAP Action Fund has received $1.4 million, Media Matters has been given nearly $1 million, and the Environmental Defense Fund and its advocacy arm have taken in $3 million from funds in Arabellaâs network.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPGroups in Arabellaâs network have been pushing initiatives such as ending the filibuster in the Senate and packing the Supreme Court. Demand Justice, one such group pushing to expand courts, is housed at the Arabella-managed Sixteen Thirty Fund. White House press secretary Jen Psaki served as an outside advisor to Demand Justice, and Paige Herwig, Bidenâs point person on judicial nominations, also worked with the group. The Sixteen Thirty Fund also steered $55 million in anonymous cash into the 2020 elections to groups that worked to elect Biden. When asked for comment on the administration's ties to dark money groups, White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates pointed to a 2019 comment given to The Washington Post â that Biden will work to remove private money from federal elections, advocate for constitutional amendments to overturn Citizens United, and ""end the era of unbridled spending by super PACs.""Cameron Cawthorne is a Fox News Digital editor

    FacebookTwitterGoogle+InstagramRSSEmailAbortionPublished 15 mins agoAOC says Planned Parenthood promotes births, saves livesThe New York Democrat said she was a 'Planned Parenthood baby'
        By
        Morgan Phillips | Fox NewsFacebookTwitterFlipboardCommentsPrintEmailcloseFox News Flash top headlines for May 6Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made an impassioned case arguing those who truly value life must support Planned Parenthood, noting ""how many babies have been born"" because of prenatal services offered by the organization. The New York Democrat also said that she was a ""Planned Parenthood"" baby, as her mother relied on prenatal services offered by Planned Parenthood before her birth. ""If we want to talk about Planned Parenthood letâs talk about how many lives Planned Parenthood has saved. And how many babies have been born because of the prenatal care provided by Planned Parenthood,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.Planned Parenthoodâs annual 2019-2020 report said it provided 354,871 abortion services and 8,626 prenatal services.She spoke during a House committee hearing titled Birthing While Black: Examining Americaâs Black Maternal Health Crisis.""If weâre concerned about life, we donât get to talk about anyone else â¦ when we are upholding policies that kill people,"" she continued. The provider offered a majority of its services to sexually transmitted infections care and treatment -- over 5.4 million. It also offered over 2.5 million contraceptive services and around 600,000 cancer screenings, and care for miscarriages, among other services. ""I donât want to hear a single person on this committee or outside of this committee talk about valuing life when they continue to uphold the death penalty, when they continue to support policies that disproportionately incarcerate and lead to the deaths of black men and people throughout this country and uphold an absolutely unjust medical system that exists for-profit that allows people to die because they canât afford to live,"" Ocasio-Cortez.""If weâre concerned about life we donât get to talk about anyone else â¦ when we are upholding policies that kill people,"" she continued.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projects that with high US immunization and moderate adherence to preventative measures, Covid hospitalizations and deaths will plummet further in the US and stay low through July.Note the first part -- vaccination and prevention -- are needed to make the second part -- low hospitalizations and deaths -- reality. And variants will remain the wild card.But at the moment, big cities are reopening. Multiple states have reported no new cases on some recent days. Only six states report rising cases over the past week, according to CNN's Covid tracker. This is good news, although tempered by a new analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington that worldwide Covid deaths, including in the US, have been vastly undercounted and could actually exceed 900,000 in the US by the fall.The advances in the US are coming as other countries are still in the throes of this disease. Read MoreThe news out of India, in particular, is heart-wrenching. Nepal could be next. But the drop in the US and in other developed countries is a step forward. They are seeing the highest rate of death of the pandemic as a second wave seizes the country. The US, emerging from its second wave, has its lowest death rate in seven months.Enter your email to subscribe to the CNN What Matters Newsletter.close dialogSign up for CNN What Matters NewsletterIn this time of political upheaval, weâre trying to connect the dots.

Weekly jobless claims fell to a pandemic low -- under 500,000 -- last week. Jobs data out Friday is expected to show the economy added a million or more jobs. The unemployment rate is not expected to match the pre-pandemic less-than 4% rate, but it could drop under its current 6%.Difficulties as the economy roars back to life. There are so very many stories about pent up demand driving up prices.Lumber is more expensive, driving up construction prices.Steel prices have tripled after the pandemic shuttered mills and the reopening drove up demand. Bank of America warned this surge is a bubble. But for now, prices are high.The computer chip shortage slowing car manufacturing is getting worse.Factories can't find workers. This is only partially a pandemic problem, but it's a $1 trillion issue for US manufacturers.Restaurants can't find enough chicken to sell, according to the Wall Street Journal. Prices are through the roof.Restaurants can't find workers as they try to open up. A New York restaurateur, Philippe Massoud, told CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich he can't open for lunch and is in a ""new war of survival.""  He's got 15 open positions from manager to dishwasher.Some are blaming lingering fears about Covid and some restaurant workers left the business. Massoud and others are blaming generous unemployment benefits creating a ""conflict of interest"" for workers.Montana's Republican governor, Greg Gianforte, said his state will now reject some federal unemployment benefits starting in June.""Montana is open for business again, but I hear from too many employers throughout our state who can't find workers. Nearly every sector in our economy faces a labor shortage,"" Gianforte said earlier this week in a statement.People are going to desperate lengths to buy houses, offering six figures over asking in some places, and seven figures over asking in weird markets like the Bay Area.There are continued concerns about inflation -- when prices rise and eat into the purchasing power of a dollar. It would equal a sort of pay cut for everyone.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, and then walked back, the obvious fact that the Fed may need to hike interest rates to tamp down on inflation, rattling investment markets.CNN's Julia Horowitz put all that into context:Big picture: Whether investors want it to or not, post-Covid inflation has arrived. What matters is whether higher prices are transient, as Yellen forecasts, or turn out to have staying power.""The question is not whether there will be some inflation this year, but whether it will represent 'overheating' of the economy as a whole,"" J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, wrote in a column published Tuesday.Anyone who normally reads this newsletter and wonders where all the good news is will have gotten to this portion today and see this next bit coming: on the economy, at least, it's possible to have too much of a good thing.What else?Making it harder to vote: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signs restrictive voting billMaking it easier to carry a gun: Texas moves toward permit-free gun carrying, joining five other states this yearBreaking up is hard to do: Four months into Brexit, the UK and France have resorted to gunboat diplomacy over fishMore and more freebies for the vaccinated: US rolls out carrots and expands access in push to get holdouts vaccinated against Covid-19Going vegan: One of the world's top restaurants is ditching meat.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) appears on track to replace Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) as chair of the House Republican Conference, gaining key endorsements including from former President Donald Trump, but some of her more right-wing colleagues believe she is ill-fit to lead a conference composed mostly of staunch conservatives.

  ASSOCIATED PRESS 
  
 
 
Key Facts 
 
  
  Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a member of the right-wing Freedom Caucus, said in a radio interview that Stefanikâs past votes against border wall funding and dismantling the Affordable Care Act show she is ânot in stepâ with the âgeneral viewsâ of Republicans.  
  
  
  Roy, who opposed Electoral College objections despite being a staunch policy conservative, is perfectly positioned to oppose Stefanik, whose embrace of Trump and support for overturning the election belies her relatively moderate voting record. 
  PROMOTED 
  
  
  Roy is not alone, according to aides to two Freedom Caucus members, who told Forbes there is a group of lawmakers that opposes picking Stefanik to replace Cheney and that more public criticism will likely emerge â though Stefanik is currently running unopposed. 
   
  
  
  âWhy canât the Freedom Caucus ever just take a win? Stop being fucking stupid and get behind Elise,â one aide said, adding that the group had an internal phone call on Wednesday to discuss Stefanik. 
  
  
  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who strongly supported Trumpâs election challenges, told a right-wing news outlet âvoting records are very importantâ and said she prefers âpassing grades and not failing gradesâ from conservative groups, though she noted Trump has a âwarm spot in his heart for Elise.â 
  
  
  Still, Stefanik appears to have her right flank mostly covered with support from Freedom Caucus vice chair Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), as well as members of the conservative Republican Study Committee such as Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.), who is whipping votes for her. 
  
  
  Stefanikâs office declined a request for comment from Forbes. 
  
 
Crucial Quote 
âElise Stefanik is NOT a good spokesperson for the House Republican Conference,â Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group with ties to the Freedom Caucus, tweeted. âShe is a liberal with a 35% CFGF lifetime rating, 4th worst in the House GOP. House Republicans should find a conservative to lead messaging and win back the House Majority.â 
Tangent 
One anonymous Republican lawmaker told the New York Post they were turned off by Stefanik ârunning for the position before it was even open,â with another telling the outlet Republicans falling behind Stefanik so soon are âjumping the gun â bad strategy.â 
Key Background 
Stefanik, who represents what was until recently a highly competitive district, is bolstered by her public loyalty to Trump since she fiercely defended him during his first impeachment trial. Helping her further is that E-PAC, a public action committee she founded in 2019 to increase the number of Republican women in Congress, bankrolled dozens of women now serving in the House â including, ironically, two separate $5,000 to Cheney in 2019 and 2020. 
Surprising Fact 
Just one Republican, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) has publicly come out in support of Cheney so far, a sign that much of the conference has turned against her even after reelecting her by a 2-to-1 margin in February. The other 8 Republicans who voted with Cheney and Kinzinger to impeach Trump in January are also behind her, according to Politico. 
Chief Critic 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly accused GOP leadership of seeking a woman to replace Cheney who will accede to their demands, quipping in a statement that they want a ânon-threatening female.â Asked for her opinion on Stefanik during a PBS Newshour interview Thursday, Pelosi said âmaybe sheâs more, shall we say, compliant,â which Stefanik slammed as a âsick sexist smear.â 
 
What To Watch For 
Even Cheney appears to acknowledge her ouster, which is expected to come as soon as next week, is a foregone conclusion, bashing her colleagues for their continued embrace of Trump in a Washington Post op-ed on Wednesday. Stefanik, meanwhile, doesnât seem to be taking anything for granted and plans to address the Freedom Caucus next week, according to Punchbowl News.

Ron DeSantis of Florida signed new voting restrictions into law. The moves advance a national Republican effort to roll back access to voting begun in the wake of President Donald J. Trumpâs loss in the 2020 presidential election, and his subsequent false claims that expansion of ballot access led to rampant voter fraud.  In Florida, the law limits the use of popular ballot drop boxes, adds identification requirements for voters requesting absentee ballots and requires them to request absentee ballots for each election, rather than sign up for them automatically.The Texas bill would, among other restrictions, greatly empower partisan poll watchers, ban election officials from mailing out absentee ballot applications and impose strict punishments for those who provide assistance that runs outside of the lines of what is permissible. The state already has some of the most onerous voting rules and regulations in the country. There is movement in virtually every state with a Republican-controlled legislature â including in Michigan and Arizona, where G.O.P. lawmakers are conducting an audit of the November results, an exercise that has been plagued by lapses in basic security and accounting procedures.Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia also signed a bill in March to limit voting access in the state, making it the first major battleground to overhaul its election system since last yearâs presidential race.Official audits of election results around the country, conducted by officials from both parties, found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election.Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Louisiana on Thursday, Karine Jean-Pierre, the deputy White House press secretary, said that the Florida law is âbuilt on a lieâ and that the state is moving âin the wrong direction.ââThe 2020 election was one of the most secure elections in American history,â she said. âThereâs no legitimate reason to change the rules right now to make it harder to vote.âMr. DeSantis gave Fox News, his preferred major cable news outlet â and Mr. Trumpâs â  an exclusive to broadcast the bill-signing ceremony from West Palm Beach on Thursday morning, in an event that resembled a campaign rally as much as an official act of state government.Supporters of Mr. DeSantis gathered inside a Hilton near the airport, donning DeSantis and Trump campaign gear. Before they entered, some people waved Trump-DeSantis and DeSantis 2024 banners, according to photos on social media shared by journalists locked outside the doors.âRight now, I have what we think is the strongest election integrity measures in the country,â a seated Mr. DeSantis told Fox as a rowdy crowd cheered behind him.Giving exclusive access to a cable news network was unusual, if not unprecedented. A reporter from a local CBS station said it was supposed to carry the broadcast feed for other stations, a practice known as pooling, but was also not allowed inside.â Patricia Mazzei, Glenn Thrush, Nick Corasaniti and Reid J.

The U.S. could return to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran in weeks, a senior official says.Iranâs chief negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, attending the Joint Commission in Vienna last week.Credit...EU Delegation in Vienna, via ReutersThe United States and Iran could each come back into compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal within weeks, a senior State Department official said on Thursday, on the eve of what could be a final round of negotiations before an agreement is brokered.The comments were an optimistic signal by the Biden administration that an American return to the accord between Iran and world powers could be within reach.Briefing journalists on the condition of anonymity, the senior official described the likelihood of an agreement before Iranâs presidential elections in mid-June as both possible and doable. He did not rule out that it could come in the round of talks that begin on Friday in Vienna.Still, the official cautioned that the United States and Iran continued to diverge on the extent to which each side needed to comply with the original terms of the 2015 deal â namely, unwinding economic sanctions by Washington in exchange for Tehran scaling back its nuclear program.The Trump administration withdrew from the deal in 2018 to pressure Iran into a broader agreement that would have also limited its missile program and military activities across the Middle East. Later that year, the United States reimposed sanctions on Iranâs key financial sectors to try to force Tehran back to the bargaining table.Instead, Iran  accelerated its nuclear program, raising its prospects for building a weapon.President Biden has pledged to rejoin the accord, but also called for  a âlonger and strongerâ deal afterward to curb Iranâs missile program and its support for proxy forces in places such as Iraq, Syria and Yemen.As American negotiators warned in recent weeks that an agreement on reviving the 2015 deal may ultimately be thwarted, Iranian officials cast the negotiations in a far rosier light.In a twist on Thursday â and as the senior State Department official predicted a possible breakthrough on the horizon â Iranâs chief negotiator urged caution.âWe are in agreement on the path we have to take although we do have serious challenges. We have a long way ahead of us; itâs impossible to determine or predict a timetable,â Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran said in Vienna on Thursday. âThe problems that remain are serious and must be resolved through negotiations.ââ Lara Jakes and Farnaz FassihiAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyAuditioning to replace Cheney, Stefanik calls Trump âthe strongest supporterâ of the Constitution.Representative Elise Stefanik at her election night victory party in November. Ms. Stefanik has echoed Trumpâs falsehoods of rampant voter fraud, and voted to overturn the election results on Jan. 6.Credit...Cindy Schultz for The New York TimesRepresentative Elise Stefanik, campaigning to oust Representative Liz Cheney as the Republican Partyâs No. 3 leader in the House for calling out President Donald J. Trumpâs election lies, pitched herself as an unshakable ally of the former president on Thursday, calling him the âstrongest supporter of any president when it comes to standing up for the Constitution.âMs. Stefanik, of New York, gave a pair of interviews on Thursday with hard-right acolytes of Mr. Trump, her first public interviews since announcing she would run for Ms. Cheneyâs post amid a drive by Republican leaders to force out the Wyoming lawmaker. She resurrected Mr. Trumpâs false narratives, citing âunprecedented unconstitutional overreachâ by election officials in 2020 and endorsing an audit in Arizona that has become the latest avenue for conservatives to try to invalidate the results.âIt is important to stand up for these constitutional issues, and these are questions that are going to have to be answered before we head into the 2022 midterms,â Ms. Stefanik told Steve Bannon, Mr. Trumpâs former strategist.In a separate interview with Sebastian Gorka, a former adviser to Mr. Trump, Ms. Stefanik said it would be her job as conference chair to represent the majority of House Republicans.âThe vast majority of the House Republicans support President Trump, and they support his focus on election integrity and election security,â Ms. Stefanik said. The job, she added later in an unmistakable jab at Ms. Cheney, âis not to attack members of the conference and attack President Trump.âMs. Stefanikâs comments captured the contrast between her and Ms. Cheney, who has relentlessly criticized the former president for falsely claiming the election was stolen and beseeched Republican lawmakers â most recently in a scathing opinion piece on Wednesday â to excise him from the party before it collapses into irrelevance.  âTrump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work â confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law,â Ms. Cheney wrote. âNo other American president has ever done this.âThough Ms. Cheney beat back an effort in February to replace her as conference chair after her vote to impeach Mr. Trump, most Republicans â even her allies â expect her to be stripped of the position as early as next week. Top Republican leaders who backed her earlier this year have moved to support Ms. Stefanik. And many of the partyâs rank-and-file members, including some who agree with Ms. Cheneyâs caustic assessments of Mr. Trump, say privately that they have grown weary of her determination to continue publicly repudiating his lies and rebuking members of her own party for their role in fueling the falsehoods that inspired the Jan. 6. riot at the Capitol.â Catie EdmondsonBiden sells his infrastructure plan in Louisiana, a state with a resonant history on the topic.President Biden in Lake Charles, La., before speaking on the American Jobs Plan.Credit...Alex Brandon/Associated PressPresident Biden traveled to Louisiana on Thursday to pitch his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal and lash out at his predecessor, former President Donald J. Trump, in a state whose physical and political landscape has been defined by road, bridge and school projects.âIâm not ready to do nothing,â Mr. Biden said while standing in the shadow of the I-10 bridge in Lake Charles, a sagging structure that was built to last for 50 years â in 1952. âIâm not ready to have another period where America has another infrastructure month and doesnât change a damn thing,â he added.Venting frustration at Mr. Trump, he noted, âLast four years, how many times do you say this is going to be âInfrastructure Week?â Well, I got so tired of hearing Infrastructure Week, nothing happened. Nothing has happened.âMr. Biden began his one-day trip by visiting conservative, industrial Lake Charles, which was inundated by Hurricanes Laura and Delta last year, to survey the rebuilding and to promote his plan to pump about $50 billion into projects that would fortify existing infrastructure against natural disaster.He went on to New Orleans to tour the aging Carrollton Water Plant, which is responsible for water purification and flood management, to make the case for funding âstorm-hardeningâ upgrades that will prevent the kind of environmental cataclysm that resulted from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.âYou are the first president who highlighted and elevated the water infrastructure as an issue for the whole country,â Ghassan Korban, the executive director of the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans, told Mr. Biden as they began touring the water treatment facility.At Lake Charles, Mr. Biden was joined by a Republican mayor and the Democratic governor of Louisiana, in an effort to demonstrate that his proposals have bipartisan support at the local level, if not in Congress.In visiting Louisiana, Mr. Biden chose a state whose infrastructural legacy was defined by a very different leader â Huey P. Long, the stateâs dictatorial governor in the 1920s and 1930s â who was equally intent on pushing it into prosperity through a massive government effort to build bridges, roads and schools.Mr. Long, known as âThe Kingfish,â died young with a tarnished legacy. But he left a  record of accomplishment in infrastructure with few parallels in U.S. history, overseeing the paving of 2,301 miles of highway (only 331 miles were paved before he took office), while building 111 bridges, dozens of schools and a soaring State Capitol building in Baton Rouge. In Mr. Longâs day, the working-class voters he wanted to attract were almost invariably Democrats. In contrast, in 2020, former President Donald J. Trump defeated Mr. Biden by nearly 20 points in the state. But Mr. Biden is hoping to reclaim some of that lost political ground with those voters, while emphasizing his commitment to combating climate change for his partyâs base. His trip to the Gulf Coast reflects a hybrid of the two political approaches.â Glenn Thrush and Annie KarniNearly one million people signed up for Obamacare coverage this spring.President Biden speaking in Columbus, Ohio, in March, on the 11th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law.Credit...Leah Millis/ReutersNearly one million Americans have signed up for Affordable Care Act coverage during the first 10 weeks of a special open enrollment period the Biden administration began in February.A total of 940,000 people enrolled in Obamacare coverage between Feb. 15 and April 30, new data released Thursday by Health and Human Services shows. Of those new enrollees, nearly half bought coverage last month, after Congress added billions in subsidies included in the most recent stimulus package.With that additional funding, the average monthly premium that Healthcare.gov consumers paid fell to $86 for those signing up in April, down from $117 in February and March (before the new subsidies).The surge in sign-ups reflects a growing demand for health insurance. Many Americans have lost job-based coverage during the pandemic, and others who were uninsured before found themselves newly interested in coverage. The numbers undercount the overall new insurance sign-ups; they reflect enrollment only in the 36 states with marketplaces that the federal government manages.The increase most likely reflects increased publicity about the opportunity, the availability of more financial help with premiums, and health fears related to the pandemic. The Trump administration made deep cuts in advertising and marketing for Healthcare.gov. The Biden administration reversed many of those changes, committing to spending $100 million to advertise this new enrollment period.The new subsidies make a substantial difference in the affordability of insurance for many Americans. About four million who are currently uninsured can qualify for plans that will cost them no premium, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation (the government subsidy would cover the entire monthly cost).Another group, higher up the income scale, qualifies for financial assistance for the first time. Some families will be eligible for discounts of more than $10,000 a year. Under the stimulus bill, these new subsidies will last until the end of 2022. But the president has said he will seek to extend them as part of his American Families Plan legislation.Around two million Americans who were already enrolled in Obamacare coverage have returned to the marketplace to take advantage of new subsidies, according to the department. That number represents a fraction of those eligible for new discounts. Biden administration officials opted against an automatic update of subsidies, and have instead been trying to encourage consumers to come back and request them individually.Everyone eligible for a new discount will get it eventually, but those who sign up now will receive monthly discounts on their insurance, while those who do not will get the money as a refund when they file their taxes next year.Sign-ups for health plans in most states will remain open until Aug. 15 this year.â Margot Sanger-Katz and Sarah KliffAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyDuring a visit to Ukraine, Blinken warns of threats from Russia â and from corruption.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/1:03-0:00transcriptU.S. Pledges Support to Ukraine Against Russian ThreatsSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken told Ukraineâs president that the United States strongly supports Ukraine against threats from Russia, which has a history of military aggression in the region.Weâre proud to have supported Ukraine in the face of years of Russian aggression and pressure, from the invasion of Crimea, the hostilities in the Donbass, and of course, Ukraine was tested again, just weeks ago this spring as Russia pushed more forces to Ukraineâs border than at any time since 2014 when it invaded. And I can tell you, Mr. President, that we stand strongly with you, the partners do as well. I heard the same thing when I was at NATO a couple of weeks ago. We look to Russia to cease reckless and aggressive actions. Weâll continue to strengthen our security partnership and keep close collaboration with you to make sure that Ukraine can defend itself against aggression. Weâre aware that Russia has withdrawn some forces from the border of Ukraine, but we also see that significant forces remain there. Significant equipment remains there. Weâre monitoring the situation very, very closely.

Blinken told Ukraineâs president that the United States strongly supports Ukraine against threats from Russia, which has a history of military aggression in the region.CreditCredit...Ukrainian Presidential press service, via ShutterstockSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken told Ukraineâs president on Thursday that the United States strongly backed his countryâs sovereignty against Russiaâs military aggression but also warned that the embattled country was under threat from âinternal forces,â including powerful oligarchs who thrive on corruption.Mr. Blinken also said that, despite Russiaâs recently announced plans to withdraw many of the 100,000 troops it had built up along the border with Ukraine in an alarming show of force this spring, a clear military threat remained.âRussia has pulled back some forces, but significant forces remain on Ukraineâs border,â Mr. Blinken noted. âAnd so Russia has the capacity on fairly short notice to take aggressive actions if it so chooses.â Mr. Blinken added that the United States was âwatching this very, very carefully.âMr. Blinken spoke at a joint news conference with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who effusively thanked the first senior Biden official to visit Kyiv since the departure of President Donald J. Trump from office. The former president ensnared Mr. Zelensky in a global scandal that the Ukrainian leader clearly hopes to forget. Asked whether efforts in 2019 by Mr. Trumpâs personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, had âset backâ efforts to drive corruption out of Ukraineâs political system, Mr. Zelensky boasted about his reform record, then indicated that he hopes the matter is finished.âLetâs not talk about the past,â he said. âLetâs let bygones be bygones, and letâs discuss the future.âThat may be difficult, given an active F.B.I. investigation into Mr. Giuliani that culminated last week in a raid on his apartment and office. Federal agents were reportedly seeking evidence of his role in the May 2019 removal of the American ambassador to Ukraine, allegedly at the behest of Mr. Giulianiâs Ukrainian associates.Mr. Blinken for his part maneuvered around a question featuring Mr. Giuliani, but reminded Mr. Zelensky â whose reform record has drawn mixed reviews â that âeffectively combating corruption is one of the most important issues to the Ukrainian people, and is crucial to improving their lives.ââ Michael CrowleyThe chair of the S.E.C. testified on meme stocks and market structure.Gary Gensler, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Credit...Kayana Szymczak for The New York TimesGary Gensler, the newly installed chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, testified before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. He addressed the meme-stock volatility in January that led to trading restrictions and prompted an outcry about Wall Streetâs relationship with retail investors.âI think these events are part of a larger story about the intersection of finance and technology,â Mr. Gensler said in his prepared remarks, highlighting seven factors at play that also hint at his regulatory priorities in the months ahead:Gamification. Fun features combined with predictive analytics on trading apps increase engagement. Watching a movie based on a streaming app recommendation, âwe might lose a couple of hours,â Mr. Gensler said. âFollowing the wrong prompt on a trading app, however, could have a substantial effect on a saverâs financial position.â He suggested it may be time for new rules to address the practice.Payment-for-order flow. Many retail brokers donât charge fees for trades, earning money instead by directing customer orders to wholesalers to execute. More trades generate more payments, which raises questions about conflicts of interest, consumer protection and data aggregation, Mr. Gensler said.Market structure. A few wholesalers account for a growing share of retail stock trading volume, with Citadel Securities particularly dominant. This concentration can âlead to fragility, deter healthy competition and limit innovation,â Mr. Gensler said.Short-selling transparency. He wants to increase âtransparency in the stock loan market.âSocial media. Investors exchanging views online is fine, but Mr. Gensler worries bad actors take advantage of legitimate debates. In particular, this risks sending false signals to algorithms that some investors use to gauge the ârelationships between words and prices.âPlumbing. When brokers restricted customer trading in meme stocks, they blamed clearinghouses and two-day settlement times. Mr. Gensler said same-day settlement is technologically possible and has asked for a draft proposal on speeding up settlement.Systemic risks. The S.E.C. will issue a report over the summer, the chair said, examining what happened in detail during the meme-stock frenzy and considering âwhether expanded enforcement mechanisms are necessary.ââ Ephrat LivniThe F.E.C. asks Congress to ban prechecked recurring donation boxes.The Federal Election Commission serves as the nationâs top election watchdog agency.Credit...Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe Federal Election Commission voted unanimously on Thursday to recommend that Congress ban political campaigns from guiding donors by default into recurring contributions through prechecked boxes, a month after a New York Times investigation showed that former President Donald J. Trumpâs political operation had steered huge numbers of unwitting supporters into repeated donations through that tactic.The bipartisan commission, which serves as the nationâs top election watchdog agency, is divided evenly between three Democratic-aligned commissioners and three Republicans, a composition that often leads to stalemate. But commissioners of both parties, including three Republicans appointed by Mr. Trump, came together on Thursday to ask Congress to strengthen campaign finance law to protect online donors.âItâs important that donors be able to exercise their choices freely,â Ellen L. Weintraub, a longtime Democratic commissioner on the F.E.C., said in an interview. âIf their money is being taken from them because of some reverse checkoff option they didnât notice, then they are not giving their money freely.ââItâs almost like theft,â Ms. Weintraub added. âI donât want to see donors tricked.âThe Times investigation showed how the Trump operation, facing a cash crunch last fall, had deployed prechecked boxes to enroll every donor in weekly withdrawals â unless they unchecked the box. Then the Trump operation made the disclaimer that disclosed that fact increasingly opaque with extraneous text. The Trump operation also prechecked a second box, known as a âmoney bomb,â that doubled a personâs contribution.Demands for refunds soared and credit card companies experienced a surge of fraud complaints, the investigation found.In addition to the F.E.C.âs recommendation, Facebook said it was reviewing its policies for advertisers who link to prechecked recurring donation pages. Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman, said that such tactics did not violate the companyâs existing policies for political fund-raising but that âweâre taking a close look at how this fund-raising practice is used on our platform to ensure that we protect the people using our services.ââ Shane GoldmacherAdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe United States turns a corner in the pandemic, but threats remain.The Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles on Wednesday. Many public spaces have been coming back to life as more people are vaccinated.Credit...Philip Cheung for The New York TimesAmericans have entered a new, hopeful phase of the pandemic. Buoyed by a sense that the coronavirus is waning, in part because of vaccinations, more people are venturing into restaurants and returning to their prepandemic routines.Mayors, governors and other local officials â once the bearers of grim news about the virusâs toll and strict rules for businesses â have joined in the newfound optimism, rapidly loosening restrictions.Public health experts remain cautious, but said that while they still expect significant local and regional surges in the coming weeks, they do not think they will be as widespread or reach past peaks.âWeâre clearly turning the corner,â said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.The nation is recording about 49,000 new cases a day, the lowest number since early October, and hospitalizations have plateaued at around 40,000, a similar level as the early fall. Nationwide, deaths are hovering around 700 a day, down from a peak of more than 3,000 in January.In the past, lulls in the pandemic were short-lived. But now, there is one crucial difference: More than half of American adults â 148 million people â have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Cases, hospitalizations and deaths have also fallen at a time when the weather is getting warmer, allowing people to spend more time outdoors, where the virus spreads less easily.The situation in the United States stands in stark contrast to other parts of the world, where many countries are still scrambling to secure access to vaccines. India remains in dire crisis, and thousands of people are dying each day in Brazil.Even in the United States, there remain strong reasons for caution. Vaccinations are slowing, and experts now believe that herd immunity may not be attainable. More transmissible variants of the virus are also spreading.A modeling study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday, citing relaxed restrictions and a new, contagious variant, suggested that cases could tick upward again in the coming weeks, before a sharp drop-off by July.Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the C.D.C., said, âWe are not out of the woods yet, but we could be very close.ââ Julie Bosman and Sarah MervoshSite IndexSite Information NavigationÂ© 2021 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions
